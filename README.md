# SECOND-YEAR-PROJECT
This is a project created in fulfilment of the requirements of the CSC 227 course unit as a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at the University of Nairobi.

# Project Description
With the Covid 19 pandemic, the rental and real estate
industry is rapidly expanding. This is a result of how many
people are moving due to jobs, educational pursuits, and
travel.

Finding a place that best suits you and your needs, on the
other hand, is a difficult task. This is especially difficult for new
tenants because they have no idea what to look for.
Furthermore, rental scams cause people to lose a lot of
money. As a result, it is critical to have a web-based platform
that provides a credible way to connect owners with clients.
This project was aimed address issues that Kenyans face in
their search for affordable and available housing. There is a
greater need than ever before to connect home owners
directly to clients in need of housing. While most system
requirements have been met, there will always be room for
improvement
