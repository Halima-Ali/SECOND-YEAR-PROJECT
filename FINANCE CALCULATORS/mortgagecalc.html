   Consumers use mortgage calculators to calculate monthly payments, and mortgage lenders use them to assess a home loan
   applicant's financial suitability. The loan principal, balance, periodic compound interest rate, number of payments per
   year, total number of payments, and regular payment amount are the major variables in a mortgage calculation. Other
   costs associated with a mortgage, such as local and state taxes, and insurance, can be factored into more complex
   calculators.

 <div class="how-to">
   <h1>How to calculate mortgage payments</h1>  
  Our mortgage calculator gives you the opportunity to customize your mortgage details.Remember, your monthly house payment includes more than just repaying the amount you borrowed to purchase the home. The
  "principal" is the amount you borrowed and have to pay back (the loan itself), and the interest is the amount the lender
  charges for lending you the money.

  <h2>Home price</h2>
  
  The price is either the amount you paid for a home or the amount you may pay for a future home purchase.
  
  <h2>Down payment</h2>
  
  Most home loans require at least 3% of the price of the home as a down payment. Some loans, like VA loans and some USDA
  loans allow zero down. Although it's a myth that a 20% down payment is required to obtain a loan, keep in mind that the
  higher your down payment, the lower your monthly payment. A 20% down payment also allows you to avoid paying private
  mortgage insurance on your loan.

  <h2>Interest rate</h2>
  
  Mortgage interest is the cost you pay your lender each year to borrow their money, expressed as a percentage rate. The
  calculator auto-populates the current average interest rate.
  
  <h2>Loan Term in years</h2>
  
  Your loan program can affect your interest rate and total monthly payments. You can input any lenght of loan term to see how different loan terms mean different monthly
  payments.
